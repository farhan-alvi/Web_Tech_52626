         HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> and it is the basic building block of the web.
         <em>It is used to create the structure of a web page by defining headings, paragraphs, links,
         images, and other elements</em>. Every website on the internet uses HTML in some form.
         <mark>HTML works by using tags that tell the browser how to display the content.</mark>                   
         Learning HTML is very important for students because it helps them understand how
         web pages are created and how information is organized on the internet.
